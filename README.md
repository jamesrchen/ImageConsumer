# ImageConsumer
Digesting images is my job

#### Requires node.js 8.15.0

This bot can filter images using ai. Try it yourself by doing the following steps:
- git clone this
- go to that directory and run 'npm i'
- create a .env file in the directory and type in 'token=the token of your bot'
- edit any other settings in index.js
- run 'node index'


## What is this bot for
Discord Hack week, and a proof of concept that ai can be leveraged for moderation purposes on discord.

## What commands are there
None, it is mean to be hosted privately(or at least for the time being)
Bot token goes in .env and the configuration in index.js is straight forward

###### THIS PROJECT USES Discord.js & NSFW.JS WHICH MAKES THIS SUPER SIMPLE TO CREATE
What I intend to do in the future is to allow users to upload photos to retrain models and allow the bot to become more customizable
