# ImageConsumer
Digesting images is my job

This bot can filter images using ai. Try it yourself by doing the following steps:
- git clone this
- go to that directory and run npm i
- create a .env file in the directory and type in token=the token of your bot
- edit any other settings in index.js
- run node index


## What is this bot for
Discord Hack week, and a proof of concept that ai can be leveraged for moderation purposes on discord.

## What commands are there
None, it is mean to be hosted privately(or at least for the time being)
Bot token goes in .env and the configuration in index.js is straight forward
